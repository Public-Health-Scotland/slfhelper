Description: This package provides a few helper functions for working with the
    Source Linkage Files (SLFs). The functions are mainly focussed on making the 
    first steps of analysis easier. They can read in and filter the files in an efficient
    way using minimal syntax. If you find a bug or have any ideas for new functions
    or improvements get in touch or submit a pull request.
