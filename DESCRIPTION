Description: This package provides a few helper functions for working with
    the Source Linkage Files (SLFs). The functions are mainly focussed on
    making the first steps of analysis easier. They can read in and filter
    the files in an efficient way using minimal syntax. If you find a bug
    or have any ideas for new functions or improvements get in touch or
    submit a pull request.
