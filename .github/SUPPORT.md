# Getting help with slfhelper

Thanks for using slfhelper!
Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat! 
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). 
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

## Where to ask?

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask). 

*   If it's a question: start with [the SLF Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a94a97159a3c44358b2244ee450d4fc27%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=c7901246-d78a-48a7-b8bb-2300aae094f3&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a).  

*   If it's a bug: you're in the right place, [file an issue](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/slfhelper/issues/new).  
  
*   If you're not sure: feel free to do either!

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/slfhelper/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
